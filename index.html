  <!-- Problem Section -->
  <section class="problem-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Why subscriptions get cancelled (and why it feels out of your control)</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Most customers don't cancel because they're done forever.</p>
      <p class="section-intro">They cancel because:</p>
      <ul class="reason-list">
        <li>They have too much product right now</li>
        <li>They want to pause spending temporarily</li>
        <li>They forgot they were subscribed</li>
        <li>They don't want to talk to support</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="section-conclusion">
        When the only option is <em>Cancel</em>, that's what they choose — even when delay would have solved the problem.

  <!-- Solution Section -->

      <h2>What Before You Cancel does</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Before You Cancel adds a <strong>Delay delivery</strong> option directly into your existing cancellation flow.
      </p>
      <p class="section-intro">When a subscriber clicks "Cancel", they're first offered a simple alternative:</p>
      <ul class="benefit-list">
        <li>Delay the next shipment</li>
        <li>Keep their subscription active</li>
        <li>No coupons, no negotiations, no tickets</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="outcome-box">
        <p><strong>You keep the customer.</strong><br>They avoid an unwanted cancellation.</p>
